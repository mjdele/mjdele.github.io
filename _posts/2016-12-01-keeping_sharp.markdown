One of the biggest challenges I have encountered while getting through the Learn-Verified Full Stack Web Development curriculum is retention.  You are constantly being introduced to brand new ideas and concepts.  The sheer amount of information you are taking in is daunting.  Luckily, the material builds on itself and by the end of a section you start to feel more comfortable and confident with the topic.  But then you have to move on and immerse yourself in something new.  

It helps that the subjects & material are all interconnected.  And it helps to limit the length of your breaks from the curriculum....to always be pushing forward so the older concepts aren't so distant.  And while creating, keeping and referencing old flashcards is also helpful, I recently started to feel a bit disconnected from that abstract, problem-solving headspace you get in when trying to solve a challenging Ruby lab.  And that's where [Codewars](http://codewars.com) comes in.

A Learn instructor recommended it to me during my CLI Gem assessment after I expressed an interest in outside sources for continuing education regarding Ruby.  In short, it's a free-to-join online community where you start as a beginner and advance ranks by completing real code challenges.....i.e. building different Ruby methods to solve problems.  In the short time that I've been signed up and using it, I've found it to be the perfect warm-up for the Learn curriculum.  It's just a great way to build on Ruby fundamentals, apply the things you have learned so far, and have plenty of "Oh, I remember that..." moments as well.  

Like any language, it seems that the best practice is daily usage, so why not take some time before your next Learn session and solve something like this...
