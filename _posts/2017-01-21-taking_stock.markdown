I am reaching the end of the Sinatra section of the curriculum, and a friend recently asked how things are going with the program.  

I said that it is like I have been working on building a house for the last several months....keeping my head down and getting buried in all of the planning details....laying the foundation, but I'm finally to the point where I can take a step back and actually see the frame and shape of the house.  

It is a satisfying feeling.  

The Model-View-Controller paradigm pulls together all of the concepts that I have been working on and connects them logically to form the framework of a website.  The Model using the object oriented Ruby programming; the View utilizing HTML; and the Controller acting as the go-between.....add-in ActiveRecord to provide database support, run "shotgun" and I am finally looking at a functioning (though quite sparse :) web application that presents and stores information and has multiple pages.  

It seems like a small victory but I have found that these things are important to celebrate when you're constantly being humbled by new material because it's easy to forget how far you have come.  

It is a long way from Tic-Tac_Toe, with so much further to go.
