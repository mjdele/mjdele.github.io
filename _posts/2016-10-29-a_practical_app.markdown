Simply enough, my story begins with a magazine article.  

In the summer of 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek published a 38,000 word article entitled [“What is Code?”](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/), which I ended up finishing in one sitting.

I just couldn’t stop reading it.  

In short, it opened my eyes.  It pulled back the curtain just enough on a subject that until that point I had found impossibly inaccessible.

My interest was piqued.  I've always been intrigued by how things work, which has to have been fed by the countless hours of my youth spent helping (mostly watching) my father work/tinker in his garage on various household projects.  From electricians work to shaping/staining woodwork to arc welding, he seemingly checked every box of the weekend warrior.  It taught me that every problem is approachable and any new topic can be learned.  You just have to commit and be willing to fail.

It also helps if you have a good teacher.

Jump ahead to fall of 2015, and although I can’t exactly pinpoint when and how I came across Learn-Verified, I do specifically recall the feeling I had after reading about the program that becoming a software developer was an actual possibility.  There was a direct path.  

After an info-session, I found myself legitimately inspired by the genuine enthusiasm of the presenter.  Once I began the curriculum, the practical, lab-based approach drew me in the most.  Learn, attempt, fail, repeat...until you pass the lab.  Then onto the next topic.  And no matter how little, in the end you have created something.  There are tangible results.  It is as hands-on (so to speak) and practical as being back in the garage.

I enjoy the creativity of work.  Discovering all the different ways to get from point A (a broken program) to point B (a working one), but eventually understanding and trying to nail down the most efficient one.

I like that it's difficult and challenging.  

I like that it's dynamic, layered and constantly evolving.  

Code is the present and the future.  It is just not going away.  And I'm excited for what lies ahead.
