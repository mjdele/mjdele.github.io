I find it extremely appropriate that the name of The Flatiron School's online platform is "Learn."  

The name clearly describes the mountains of material concerning all things software development.  After all, there is certainly a lot to learn in the curriculum.  But I find that the greater meaning of the name is expressed in the way the course teaches you ***how to learn.***  You figure out fairly early on how varied the path from question (usually in the form of a lab) to answer can be.  While there is still value in re-reading the primary source material in order to possibly find something you missed when you get stuck on a problem, the Learn platform teaches you to branch out when looking for the solutions.  

When discussing the curriculum with friends, I think the thing I say most often is that if you find yourself stuck on a particular issue, there is almost a 100% chance that someone else has too and asked about it on a discussion board or written an entire blog about the issue.  You just need to start digging around on Google.  And if that doesn't work, then you can watch one of the Learn video walkthroughs covering your general topic.  Still stuck?  Then you can send out your question to the Learn instructors and have one of them walk you through it.  Or if you think it's a quick fix maybe you send out a message to the Slack group.

The point is that after going through this process time and again on the platform, you find yourself getting better at learning. 

You now have a better idea of where to look on Stack Overflow for your answer, or you have your go-to bookmark for array and hash methods when you need it.  You might remember covering a particular topic in one of the lecture videos and go back to it.  You've even gotten better at asking the instructors questions (having your particular code snippet ready, formatted and pasted right off the bat).

I have found this framework for learning just as valuable as the material that I am trying to master along the way.  It seems that as a developer you will always be met with new challenges and find yourself "stuck" at times, but having the tools, resources and community that you can lean on to find the answers is the key.
