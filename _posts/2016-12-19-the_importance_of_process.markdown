You spend almost all of your time with a broken program.  

That was one of the first things that became clear to me as I began my journey to become a developer.  Your program is riddled with multiple errors and nothing will work until you get each one solved.  And even when everything is "working" you are confronted with the question of how efficient your code really is.  There always seems to be a shorter, cleaner way to write the code you just barely got up and running.  

Refactor. Refactor. Refactor.

And voila, you have a program that works, with code you are proud of.  

But this final moment is so fleeting, especially when compared to all of the time and effort spent leading up to it.  And this cycle repeats itself, over and over, as you progress through the Learn curriculum.  

When I first began, I was singularly focussed on this end goal of "the working program."  But as I completed more and more labs, I began to see how much more important it was to focus on and form a solid, methodical ***process*** for getting my program to work.  The goal of a working, efficient, and well-written program remains.....it is always there.  But the focus should be on the process that eventually leads to that goal.  

My mentality shifted from "Are we there yet?" to "What is the next step to getting there?".  

This change has helped me mainly with completing the more difficult labs.  It's easy to feel overwhelmed when you start a lab and your main focus is on getting to the end.  But if you begin that lab the same way you began all of the others and focus in on each step: you look over the readme....you run and review your tests....you approach and solve one test at a time....one step after the next...you'll eventually find that any project is digestible by focussing just on the rigorous process of your workflow. 

And it makes sense that this is where your head should be.  If you're spending almost all of your time with a broken program, you should learn to love that journey of working through your processes to eventually succeed in your goal.  

Of course, once everything *is* working and the last step of your process is complete.....enjoy that too :)
