As I approach my Sinatra Portfolio Project and as the labs get increasingly expansive, I feel like I need to make more of an effort to better structure my approach to developing my code.  It just seems like there are so many places to start and my mind can get easily swamped with all of the tasks that need to be completed.  As a rule of thumb I do try to linearly follow the tests in their given order, but often times I'll get sidetracked on a task that just popped into my head but is clearly further down the road on the list of things to complete in the lab.  Then I'm left jumping back and forth instead of focusing on one particular task at a time.  

My plan is to step back in the beginning and do more of a broad overview of what I want to accomplish before I start diving into getting my tests to pass.  I want to sketch out on a separate sheet of paper the beginning, middle, and end of my process and how everything is connected along the way.....so setting up my environment and Gemfile first, then organizing my models, their corresponding tables, and their relationships between each other, and finally mapping out my different controllers and their views.  I think that getting this down on paper will help me with getting a better holistic understanding of the project, as well as provide me with a better focus of what needs to get done and in what order as I work through it all.
